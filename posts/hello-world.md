Welcome to my first blog post on my personal tech site! Yeah, I know‚Ä¶ There is nothing more cliche than starting something coding-related with a ‚Äúhello world‚Äù but, if you remember the feeling when you wrote the very-simple-yet-magical first piece of code, and saw our traditional greeting on the terminal, that's the feeling I got while writing this post.

Why's that so special? Well, basically because I'm not the most extrovert person so, you can imagine‚Ä¶ Interestingly enough, it feels I've reached a moment in my life that sharing my thoughts, experiences, fears and accomplishments surpasses the shyness of doing so, and that's exactly what I'll start doing for now on.

‚ÄúWhat have changed in your life to spark this awakening desire?‚Äù - one might ask. Well, the truth is that I can't answer this yet. It can be me being able to finally fight past ghosts and free from chains; the feeling of having something that I am good enough to share; or even saving my current version for the future me remember of or laugh at. Well, as soon as I discover, I tell you.
